		<h1>Christoph Wong</h1>
		<p class="introduction biography">
			...is a software engineer, who has more than 2 years of professional experience as consultant software developer at ThoughtWorks. In that time, I worked on four projects for non-profit, private, and public sector clients. In software delivery, I use primarily Ruby, Javascript, and Clojure - and I am always happy to learn more.
		</p>
		<p>
			My passion includes software craftsmanship, education, and psychology.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am looking for a mid to senior role where I can learn as well as stretch my abilities as an engineer and a leader.
